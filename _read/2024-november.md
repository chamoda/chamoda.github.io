### Books

#### [How to Take Smart Notes by SÃ¶nke Ahrens (goodreads.com)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes)

This was a fascinating read on Zettelkasten note-taking techniques. Here are a few key takeaways from the book:

* Non-fiction writing is not simply a process of sitting down and writing an article or book straight from the thoughts in your head
* You have to build your knowledge/fact base long term.
* Zettelkasten (German for slip box) is a good approach for this.
* Once you have a good enough knowledge/fact base for reference, writing something good for publication is just about rephrasing and rearranging your notes.
* Good, productive writing starts with good note-taking.
* GTD (Getting things done) can't be transferred directly into insightful writing tasks.

#### [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir (goodreads.com)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary)

I picked this one up because I really enjoyed the author's previous book, The Martian, but unfortunately, this one didn't meet my expectations.
