### Books

#### [The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction by William Shotts (goodreads.com)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11724436-the-linux-command-line)

Skimmed through this one and would definitely recommend it to new developers looking to get familiar with Linux. The bookâ€™s comprehensive, practical approach makes it a great resource for learning the ropes.

### Articles

#### [Algorithms we develop software by (grantslatton.com)](https://grantslatton.com/software-pathfinding)

Conceptually (at least) valuable set of methodologies when thinking of software development as pathfinding in a problem space. In summary:

* Write everything twice
  
  Solve the problem, stash code into a branch, rewrite again (keep the unit test you wrote) for 2x higher quality code for 1.25x the time.

* "Gun to the head" heuristic
  
  Let's say you have a task that takes 2 weeks to implement. Ask the question: what would you do if someone had a gun to your head to do this in 24 hours? Work on that approach first.

#### [On writing well (zodvik.com)](https://zodvik.com/posts/on-writing-well)

Checklist to bring absolute clarity to your writings.

* Use fewer than 30 words per sentence.
* Check for words you can remove from a phrase. If meaning remains clear, just remove it.
* Check for terms your audience may not be familiar with and remove them or explain the terms along with usage.
* Check for adjectives that can be replaced with data or details.
* Ask the question "So what?" to every sentence you write.
* Rewrite sentences to use active voice over passive voice.
* Check for obsolete data and replace them with non-obsolete data (e.g., replace "in 2 weeks" with exact date).
