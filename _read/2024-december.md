## Books

## [Architecture Patterns with Python by Harry Percival (goodreads.com)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50083115-architecture-patterns-with-python)

This was an excellent introduction to domain-driven design in Python. It also explores the most common architectural patterns, highlighting their pros and cons. Overall, it was an insightful and enjoyable read.

## [The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand (goodreads.com)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122.The_Fountainhead)

The book delivers an inspiring exploration of individualism and integrity, but its density caused me to lose interest midway; I had planned to read Atlas Shrugged next, but that might be on hold for now.
