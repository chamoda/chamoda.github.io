#### Intro

I'm a software architect and serial entrepreneur specializing in building technology-driven businesses that scale. With extensive experience in Python and Go across the full stack, I architect systems that drive measurable business value and sustainable growth. My passion lies in the startup ecosystem—from founding and scaling ventures to advising early-stage companies on technical strategy and product development. I focus on transforming innovative ideas into commercially viable solutions that create lasting market impact.
