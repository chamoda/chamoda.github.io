#### Intro

I'm a software architect who discovered that building great technology is only half the fun - turning ideas into thriving businesses is where the real magic happens. With deep expertise in Python and Go across the full stack, I love crafting scalable systems that solve real problems and create meaningful impact.

* [Neurux](https://neurux.ai) - Enterprise AI platform providing secure and scalable AI solutions
