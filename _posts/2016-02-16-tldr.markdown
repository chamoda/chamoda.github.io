Man pages on unix like (Linux, OSX) systems are generally tedious to read. I've been keeping evernote notebook for a simple version of man page with commands I learned from man pages as a reminder. Also I've been using 'grep' to filter out specific commands descriptions from man pages.

Few weeks ago I found a open source tool called [tldr on github](https://github.com/tldr-pages). TL;DR stands for "Too Long; Didn't Read". It originates as an Internet slang, where it is used to indicate parts of the text skipped as too lengthy. This is a really cool tool learn or/and reference the commands line tools. Let's say you want to know how to extract tar file using tar command. Just type `tldr tar` and you will see a short and sweat output like

```
tar
Archiving utility.
Optional compression with gzip / bzip.

- Create an archive from files:
  tar cf target.tar file1 file2 file3

- Create a gzipped archive:
  tar czf target.tar.gz file1 file2 file3

- Extract an archive in a target folder:
  tar xf source.tar -C folder

- Extract a gzipped archive in the current directory:
  tar xzf source.tar.gz

- Extract a bzipped archive in the current directory:
  tar xjf source.tar.bz2

- Create a compressed archive, using archive suffix to determine the compression program:
  tar caf target.tar.xz file1 file2 file3

- List the contents of a tar file:
  tar tvf source.tar
```

You can install `tldr` using `npm` in linux or unix like systems. Just type `npm install -g tldr`.
