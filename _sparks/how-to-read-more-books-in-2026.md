Reading is the highest-leverage habit you can build. It's one of the most effective tools for building a comprehensive world model through exposure to diverse perspectives. Reading keeps your mind sharp as you age - a mental workout that strengthens neural pathways and slows cognitive decline.

**Set a concrete goal.** Whether it's 12 books a year or 24, pick a number and commit to it. Having a specific target helps you build the habit. The more you read, the better you get at reading.

**Track your progress.** Use something like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to maintain your reading list. Sign up for the annual reading challenge and make it social if that motivates you. Yes, Goodreads is a bit clunky after Amazon's acquisition, but it's good enough for tracking what you've read.

**Books don't have to be physical.** Physical books are wonderful, but don't let format limit your habit. Own a Kindle. Build a library of ebooks. I keep physical copies of [my favorites](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5980292?shelf=favorites), but I'm format-agnostic for everything else.

**Read both fiction and non-fiction.** Fiction matters too. Different types of books exercise different mental muscles.

**Add audiobooks to the mix.** They count. Use commutes, workouts, and chores as reading time.

**You don't have to read from beginning to end.** Especially with non-fiction, feel free to jump around. Read the chapters that interest you most. Skip sections that don't serve your current needs. The best reading strategy is the one that keeps you reading.
